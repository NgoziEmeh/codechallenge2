Simple Tip Calculator 

John and his family went on a holiday and visited 3 different restaurants. 

They got bills as thus: 
              First Restaurant: $124
              Second Restaurant: $48
              Third Restaurant: $268
              
              
To tip the waiters, fair amount,John created a Simple Tip Calculator.

He likes to tip:
             20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50.
             15% of the bill when the bill is between $50 and $200.
             10% of the bil when the bill is more than $200.


In the end, John will like to have 2 arrays:

             1. One array containing all the 3 tips (one for each bill).
